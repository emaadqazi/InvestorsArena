# Investors Arena

A gamified investment platform that transforms stock market education into an engaging, competitive experience by combining fantasy sports mechanics with real-time financial data.

## 📋 Project Overview

Investors Arena enables users to create and participate in private leagues where they compete by building virtual portfolios using live market data. Unlike traditional paper trading platforms, we emphasize social competition through draft-style stock selection, real-time leaderboards, and customizable league rules.
